To create a backup of your wallet (wallet.dat), follow this steps:

1. Open your wallet, goto **File** -> **Backup Wallet**

    I named my wallet.dat -> ARGONEUM-wallet.dat because Argoneum is not my only wallet backup file.
    Now your ARGONEUM-wallet.dat is saved on your local disk in C:\Backup (my choosed file location for this guide) folder and my recommendation to you is: **Save every wallet backup on USB-Stick additionally!**
